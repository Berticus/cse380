    \textit{Lab 4 Documentation}

    The objective of Lab 4 was to learn about using the general purpose
    input/output, GPIO, and how to factor code using \textbf{export} and
    \textbf{extern}. There are two parts to the program.

    First the user pushes each of the four push buttons. As the buttons are
    pushed, the corresponding LEDs light up. After each individual button has
    been pushed once, the program moves onto the second part of the program.

    The second part makes use of the UART. The user enters in a hexadecimal,
    0-9, a-f, and A-F, and it is printed on the seven-segment display. Upon
    writting either Q or q, the program quits.

    The user is given feedback by the RGB LED. When the program is waiting for
    push button input, it lights green. When the user pushes a button, it
    lights blue. When it is waiting for UART input, it lights white. Finally,
    when it exits, it lights red.

    Half of the routines were written in the previous labs. Their respective
    flowcharts are shown in Figs. \ref{flo:uart_init}, \ref{flo:chars},
    \ref{flo:output_string}, and \ref{flo:read_string}.

    All of the new routines are linear, simply reading from or writing to
    their respective register. According to the \textit{LPC2138 Education Board
    Users Guide}, the LEDs light when signals are pulled low. So sending a 1
    to them, with IOSET, turns them off, while sending a 0 to them, with IOCLR,
    turns them on.

   \input{display_digit_flow}
   \captionof{figure}{Flowchart of \textit{display\_digit} routine.}
   \label{flo:display_digit}

    As can be seen in Fig \ref{flo:display_digit}, a -1 can be sent to
    \textit{display\_digit} so that the only action that is taken is clearing
    the display, and then exit immediately. This way another routine wouldn't
    have to be made specifically to clear the display. This leaves the entire
    display control to the \textit{display\_digit} routine.

   \input{read_push_btns_flow}
   \captionof{figure}{Flowchart of \textit{read\_push\_btns} routine.}
   \label{flo:read_push_btns}

    For \textit{read\_push\_btns}, Fig. \ref{flo:read_push_btns} we don't wait
    until a push button is read, it's sole purpose is to actually read the push
    buttons. Of course it could be easily changed so that it does wait for a
    push button to be pressed. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't change
    the functionality of the program.

    \input{main_flow_2}
    \captionof{figure}{Flowchart of main program, \textit{lab4} routine, continued.}
    \label{flo:main 2}

    It should be noted the source does differ from the flowchart in a minor way.
    In Fig. \ref{flo:main 2}, there's a block stating that before exiting, the
    display is turned off. This does not happen in the code that has been
    submitted. However, two lines were added after submission to accomplish that,
    As shown in Fig. \ref{code:added}. This was placed right after the lines to
    turn the RGB LED red.

    \begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
        \begin{lstlisting}
        mov r0, #-1
        bl display_digit

        \label{code:added}
    \end{minipage}

    Albert wrote the main routine, \textit{lab4}, along with the \textit{leds}
    and \textit{rgb\_led} routines. Nipun wrote the \textit{display\_digit} and
    \textit{read\_push\_btns} routines. Since the main routine is running
    through an infinite loop anyway, it was decided having another loop in
    \textit{read\_push\_btns} would be meaningless. So the main routine simply
    polled the \textit{read\_push\_btns} routine. If no buttons were pushed, it
    wouldn't wait around for the user to push a button.
